# Random-User-API-Performance-Test

# About The Project:
In this project I have performed the load test and stress test in a specific website which is " https://random-data-api.com/api/v2/users "

# Tools & Technology Used:
1. Jmeter.
2. JDK 21`.0

# Scenario:
  Find out the actual TPS for if 120000 users can give load for 12 hours
  1.You have to find out if the expected TPS (Transaction Per/Second) meet the above requirement. Breakdown the expected TPS in excel sheet and find out the actual TPS.
  2.Create another excel sheet where you will try to find out the bottleneck/stress test point. (At which point the system starts to show 1% error)
  
# How to run
1. Clone this project
2. Save the .jmx file in the bin folder of Jmeter
